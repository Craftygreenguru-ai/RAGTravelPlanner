This is a complete, innovative React app called "RAGTravelPlanner". 
// It uses Nuclia's RAG-as-a-service to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user inputs.
// The app is unique in combining real-time RAG-generated travel plans with interactive UI for preferences, budgets, and dates.
// Users can input preferences, and the app fetches augmented generative responses for itineraries.
